Quick View Scheduler
===========

This is a simple Java web application to create and manage workplace schedules.
It is designed to run easily in the cloud. A freely hosted version is running on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com). (Not guaranteed to be up at any time.)

 
## How does it work?

There are 3 things to be concerned with in QVScheduler.
 1. **Staff** (employees at your workplace)
 1. **Positions** (different jobs/positions at your workplace)
 1. **Shifts** (a combination of 1 staff member, a position, and a time slot)
 
## How do I get started?
1. Go to [QVScheduler](https://qvscheduler.herokuapp.com)
1. Login with a Google account. 
1. Set up your staff members and positions.
1. Build up your shifts. 
1. Print out the week's schedule on a color printer. 
1. Hang on the wall in the break room. 
1. Done! 

## Anything else?

- You can copy shifts for a particular staff member from any previous week by going to the next week and clicking the "repeat shift" icon next to the person's name.
- You can create special positions to indicate full day activities such as "offsite" or "vacation".
- You can assign colors to each position to make the printed scheduler easier to read.
